# ​ Iris Flower Classification  

This beginner-friendly ML project applies logistic regression on the Iris dataset to classify flower species with high accuracy.

## ​ Overview  
This project classifies Iris flowers into three species (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*) using Logistic Regression, and demonstrates foundational machine learning practices.

##  Learning Outcomes
- Explored and preprocessed the Iris dataset  
- Learned data splitting, model training, and evaluation  
- Applied logistic regression using Scikit-learn  
- Improved code documentation and presentation  

##  Dataset  
- Source: Scikit-learn’s built-in Iris dataset  
- Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width  
- Target: Iris species (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*)  

## ​ Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

##  Steps Performed  
1. Loaded and explored the Iris dataset  
2. Split into training and testing sets  
3. Trained a Logistic Regression model  
4. Evaluated model performance  

##  Results  
- Achieved **90%+ accuracy** on the test dataset
