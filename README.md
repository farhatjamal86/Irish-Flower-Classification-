# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification  

## 📌 Overview  
This project classifies Iris flowers into three species (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*) using Logistic Regression.  
It is one of the most popular beginner datasets in machine learning, often used for learning classification tasks.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- Source: Scikit-learn’s built-in Iris dataset  
- Features:  
  - Sepal Length  
  - Sepal Width  
  - Petal Length  
  - Petal Width  
- Target: Iris species (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*)  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## 🚀 Steps Performed  
1. Loaded and explored the Iris dataset  
2. Split dataset into training and testing sets  
3. Trained a Logistic Regression model  
4. Evaluated model performance on test set  

## 📈 Results
